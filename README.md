<center><h1>Car Type Classification</h1><center>
<p>This project is based on the convolutional neural network and computer vision technology. The model is trained to identify the car body type and the car color with an accuracy of 95%. This project could be practically used by the company which surveys the vehicles<p>
<br>
<p>This project uses the various python modules and frame work like tensorflow, keras , PIL , opencv and etc.
  In this project the model is trained using the convolutional neural networks of 4 layers which will able to classify the body type of a car <p>
